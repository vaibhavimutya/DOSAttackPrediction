This project evaluates multiple machine‑learning approaches for detecting Denial‑of‑Service (DoS) attacks on IPv6 networks using the Kaggle Intrusion Detection dataset (25,192 samples, 42 features). After one‑hot encoding and PCA (retaining 99.9% variance in two components), I implemented Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers in Python (scikit‑learn). The Random Forest model delivered the best performance with a 96.19% weighted F1 score, outperforming linear baselines and highlighting the value of non‑linear methods for security anomaly detection. Key contributions include end‑to‑end data preprocessing, feature selection via PCA, rigorous model comparison, and clear performance visualization.
